            <p>
                OER Bookr is a teacher's source for Open Educational Resources
                (OER). Picture the Yelp of text books, a social platform for peer
                reviewed, open licensed text books. Every book you could possibly think of with reviews from Noble Prize winners, Pulitzer Prize winners and the list goes on. See what some of
                the best have to say. Your difference of opinions may not be so
                different.
