              Picture the Yelp of text books, a social platform for peer
              reviewed, open licensed text books. Every book you could possibly
              think of with reviews from Noble Prize winners, Pulitzer Prize
              winners and the list goes on. See what some of the best have to
              say. Your difference of opinions may not be so different.
